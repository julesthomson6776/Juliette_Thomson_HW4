The cheack marks are going to be stop light colours so you can clearly see what needs dont and what are the most important when they are done.

I also picked the colour of the boxes a certain way where you start at a no so pretty colour and work your way to the pretty color.

When I used the code to make each of the check mark boxes I had to manualy put in all the seprate codes for each of the check marks to make sure each check mark is linked to the correct line of code. Each check mark box has its own code for it. Then I linked it to css to make it beable to be used

I ended up getting a bug and had to make another css file and transfer all my code into it

I added the note pad as the background image to have a image but still match the theme of this project so I added a notepad to tie in both things
